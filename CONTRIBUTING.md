# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to awesome-repos-and-resources! If you know of a resource or repository that would be a great fit for this list, please follow these guidelines to contribute.

## Guidelines for Contributions

- **Quality over Quantity**: We prefer quality resources that offer clear and valuable insights or information. 
- **Relevance**: Ensure that your contributions are relevant to the tech community and fit within the existing categories.
- **No Spam**: Contributions should not be promotional or spammy in nature.

## Table of Contents Guidelines

When making changes to the README.md, it's important to keep the Table of Contents (TOC) up-to-date and organized. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Adding a New Category or Subcategory**
   - If you add a new **category** or **subcategory**, please also add it to the TOC.
   - Ensure that the TOC entry links correctly to your new section.
   - Follow the existing format for TOC entries.

2. **Adding Content Within Existing Categories**
   - If you're adding content to an existing category or subcategory, **you don't need to update the TOC**.
   - GitHub automatically handles linking within the document.

3. **Maintaining Consistency**
   - Ensure that your additions follow the same formatting and style as the existing content.
   - This helps maintain a consistent and readable structure throughout the document.


## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Fork**
   - Clone your fork to your local machine.

3. **Create a New Branch**
   - Create a new branch for your contributions. 
   - Name it appropriately to reflect the nature of your changes (e.g., `add-python-resources`).

4. **Add Your Contributions**
   - Update the README.md file with your additions.
   - Please ensure that your contributions fit within the existing structure and categories.
   - If adding a new category, include a brief description of the category.

5. **Follow the Format**
   - Use the following format for each entry: `[Resource Name](link) - Brief description.`
   - Make sure the link is functional and the description succinctly captures the essence of the resource.

6. **Check for Duplicates**
   - Before submitting, please check to ensure that your contribution is not a duplicate of an existing entry.

7. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.

8. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository.
   - In your pull request description, explain your changes and reference any related issues.

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, we might ask you to make changes to your pull request. This is normal, and it helps ensure that our list remains high-quality. If you're asked to make changes:

1. Make the required updates to your local branch.
2. Commit and push the changes to your fork.
3. The pull request will automatically update with the new changes.

   ## Contributing Directly on GitHub

You can also contribute directly using the GitHub website, which is a straightforward method for making small changes without needing to use the command line.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Edit Files in Your Fork**
   - Go to your forked repository.
   - Browse to the file you want to edit.
   - Click on the file, then click the pencil icon (Edit this file) in the upper right corner to start editing.

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Make the necessary changes to the file in the web editor.
   - You can use the Preview tab to check your changes.

4. **Commit the Changes**
   - Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section.
   - Enter a commit message that clearly describes your changes.
   - Select "Commit directly to the `main` branch" or "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."
   - Click "Commit changes."

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - If you created a new branch, youâ€™ll be prompted to open a pull request.
   - Click the "Compare & pull request" button.

### Notes

- This method is best for small changes. For larger changes or new files, it's recommended to use the command line or a Git client.

By following these steps, you can contribute to the project directly from your browser, making it easy to submit small fixes and improvements.
