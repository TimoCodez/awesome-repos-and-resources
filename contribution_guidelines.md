   ## Contributing Directly on GitHub

You can also contribute directly using the GitHub website, which is a straightforward method for making small changes without needing to use the command line.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Edit Files in Your Fork**
   - Go to your forked repository.
   - Browse to the file you want to edit.
   - Click on the file, then click the pencil icon (Edit this file) in the upper right corner to start editing.

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Make the necessary changes to the file in the web editor.
   - You can use the Preview tab to check your changes.

4. **Commit the Changes**
   - Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section.
   - Enter a commit message that clearly describes your changes.
   - Select "Commit directly to the `main` branch" or "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."

By following these steps, you can contribute to the project directly from your browser, making it easy to submit small fixes and improvements.
