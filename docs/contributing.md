# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to awesome-repos-and-resources! If you know of a resource or repository that would be a great fit for this list, please follow these guidelines to contribute.

## Guidelines for Contributions

- **Quality over Quantity**: We prefer quality resources that offer clear and valuable insights or information. 
- **Relevance**: Ensure that your contributions are relevant to the tech community and fit within the existing categories.
- **No Spam**: Contributions should not be promotional or spammy in nature.

## Structure Guidelines

Our project now uses MkDocs for better organization. Here's what you need to know:

1. **File Structure**
   - Content is organized in the `docs/` directory.
   - Each main category has its own markdown file (e.g., `docs/programming-languages.md`).

2. **Adding New Content**
   - Add new resources to the appropriate category file in the `docs/` directory.
   - If you're adding a new category, create a new markdown file in the `docs/` directory.

3. **Updating Navigation**
   - If you add a new category, update the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`.

4. **Maintaining Consistency**
   - Ensure that your additions follow the same formatting and style as the existing content.
   - This helps maintain a consistent and readable structure throughout the documentation.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Fork**
   - Clone your fork to your local machine.

3. **Create a New Branch**
   - Create a new branch for your contributions. 
   - Name it appropriately to reflect the nature of your changes (e.g., `add-python-resources`).

4. **Add Your Contributions**
   - Update the appropriate markdown file in the `docs/` directory with your additions.
   - If adding a new category, create a new markdown file and update `mkdocs.yml`.

5. **Follow the Format**
   - Use the following format for each entry: `[Resource Name](link) - Brief description.`
   - Make sure the link is functional and the description succinctly captures the essence of the resource.

6. **Check for Duplicates**
   - Before submitting, please check to ensure that your contribution is not a duplicate of an existing entry.

7. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.

8. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository.
   - In your pull request description, explain your changes and reference any related issues.

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, we might ask you to make changes to your pull request. This is normal, and it helps ensure that our list remains high-quality. If you're asked to make changes:

1. Make the required updates to your local branch.
2. Commit and push the changes to your fork.
3. The pull request will automatically update with the new changes.
