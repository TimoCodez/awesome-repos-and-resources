# Security Policy

## Reporting Malicious Content or Security Concerns

We take the security and integrity of our curated resources seriously. If you believe you have found a malicious link, inappropriate content, or any security-related issue in our list, we encourage you to let us know straight away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly address the problem.

### How to Report an Issue

Please follow these steps to report a security concern or malicious content:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose**: Publicly disclosing a security issue can put the entire community at risk. If you've found a problem, please refrain from disclosing it publicly and instead let us handle it.

2. **Contact**: Send a DM to [@TimoCodes](https://twitter.com/TimoCodes) on X (Twitter). Include as much information as possible about the issue. Descriptions, proof of malicious behavior, and impact analysis are highly valuable.

3. **Timing**: After reporting an issue, give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address it before you disclose it to others.

4. **Anonymous Reporting**: If you prefer to stay anonymous, you can use free email services like ProtonMail to create an anonymous account for reporting.
